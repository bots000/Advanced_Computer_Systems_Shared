# Introduction

This project was a student-picked project, with the criteria of using either SIMD instructions or multithreading to efficiently solve some applicable problem.  The group decided to focus their efforts on improving the efficiency of image segmentation using SIMD calcuations to speed up operations that typically need to be performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

Image segmentation is concerned with automatically obtaining information about an image by processing its contents by edges, shape, size, color, or some other means of comparison.  Doing so allows certain objects in the image to be singled out from the background.  This is commonly used in industry today, with applications including medical image analysis, satellite imaging, facial recognition, and autonmous vehicles.  This project focuses on the medical aspect, and uses a data set comprised of CT scans of multiple myeloma cells.  The data set was obtained from an IEEE grand challenge, and is available to be viewed online.  A sample image from the data set is shown below.
