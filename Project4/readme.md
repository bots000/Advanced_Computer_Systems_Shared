# Introduction

This project tasked the students with utilizing simulation softwares to emulate data read/writes and measure the bandwidth/latency of these operations.  The goal of this was to develop first-hands knowledge and deeper understanding on the performance of modern memory and storage devices.  Queuing Theory topics have been previously reviewed and the course, and will be used to analyze the results generated from these simulations.
